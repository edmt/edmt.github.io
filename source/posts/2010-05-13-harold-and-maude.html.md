> I like to watch things grow. They... grow and bloom and... fade and die and change into something else. Life!

>-I love the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth... The earth is my body, my head is in the stars. Who said that?
>-I don't know.
-I suppose I did.

>-I haven't lived. I've died a few times.
>-What was that?
>-Well... The first time was when I was at boarding school, in the chemistry lab. I was in there cleaning it up so I decided I'd do a little experiment. You know, so I got all this stuff out and began mixing it up, it was very scientific! There was this massive explosion. It knocked me down, blew out a huge hole in the floor. There was boards and bricks and flames leaping up. I figured, you know... time to leave. My career in school was over. So... I went home. My mother was giving a party so I went up the back stairs to my room. Turned out the light and... I got this funny feeling. The doorbell rang. I went out to the banister and these two policemen came in, found my mother... and... told her that I was killed in the fire. She put one hand up to her forehead, the other one she reached out as if groping for support, and with this long sigh, she collapsed in their arms. I decided right then that I enjoyed being dead.

>-Do you pray?
>-Pray? No, I communicate.
