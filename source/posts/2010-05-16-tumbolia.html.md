The land of dead hiccups and extinguished light bulbs. An eternal waiting room for dissolved snowflakes and characters in stories that arenâ€™t being read. Take a stroll along the shore, all littered with the flotsam of hopes and dreams, and rummage through the sprawling assortment of ephemeral odds and ends.
