"How perfectly goddamned delightful it all is, to be sure". When I was a kid, if I ever started showing enthusiasm for anything, my brother Charles would say "How perfectly goddamned delightful it all is, to be sure". Always take the wind out of my sails. Even though I don't see him often, whenever I'm with him... it revives that keen awareness of that... of being very removed or extremely separated from the rest of humanity and the world in general. I kinda like that feeling. "How perfectly goddamned delightful it all is, to be sure".
