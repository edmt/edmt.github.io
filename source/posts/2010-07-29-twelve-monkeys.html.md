> I don't really come from outer space. [...] It is a condition of mental divergence. I find myself on the planet Ogo. Part of an intellectual elite preparing to subjugate the barbarian hordes on Pluto. But even though this is a totally convincing reality for me in every way, nevertheless, Ogo is actually a construct of my psyche. I am mentally divergent... in that I am escaping certain unnamed realities that plague my life here. When I stop going there, I will be well. Are you also divergent, friend?

> You know, you people don't exist. You are not real. We can't travel back in time. You are not here. You can't trick me. You are in my mind, you are in my mind! I am insane. And you are my insanity.

> What if I am wrong? What if you are wrong? What if I am crazy?
