El siguiente texto lo encontré hace meses en la sala de computadoras de la facultad, en una máquina que solía utilizar cada día durante la clase. No sé quién lo escribió ni por qué lo dejó al alcance de manos ajenas y, particularmente, no sé por qué en mi máquina. ¿Debía leerlo yo?

En cualquier caso, aún conservo el texto porque significa algo. Son los pensamientos de alguien de mi edad, alguien como yo, que vive en la misma ciudad y que comparte un mismo contexto.

<strong>Our Local Horror Story</strong>

Nowadays, we live a real frightening story that everyday reminds us that life is too short. Many of our relatives keep telling us that before this generation (to which I belong) was born, this kind of events did not exist.

Monterrey always was known as a beautiful city, with hard-working people who like to continue improving day by day. But these days are gone and now we live in those environment only movies showed.

The traffic of drugs and the lust for money are the factors that now move our society, increasing violence because everyone wants more and more... and they just can't get enough. It is sad because many of us were accostumed to those days in which your life was not in risk.

Maybe we all might propose a lot of things, maybe good ideas might come, but... Are we really brave enough to leave our vices and follow the right thing? The first step would be to face our problems, I mean our individual problems. It is important to take conscience what we are living. This situation cannot continue, it is not human to live in hiding.

I think the most important comes from the inside out. To teach the old values and go back to basics. I think there is no solution to the actual situation, so we need to focus on children, and transmit to them the real good things. To protect them and protect our families. For the actual dealers... We can just wait for them to die.
